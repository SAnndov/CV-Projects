This project's folder is consisted of 3 different files: **the titanic(raw)** is the raw csv file that needed to be cleaned and analyzed after that.
The second file is **titanic_data (cleaned)** which is the exported csv file from the MySQL so it can be visualized afterwards in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Power BI. 
And the last file is the **Ttianic_data.csv(Cleaning and analysing the data)** that is a .sql file in which all the SQL coding is written so that the data analysis  can be done and different tasks can be answered. 
The titanic (raw) includes twelve columns **(PassengerId,Survived,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked)**.
